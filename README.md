"Predicting Income Levels with Machine Learning: Unlocking Insights from Data"
Project Objective:

The project aims to predict income levels (e.g., above or below $50k) based on demographic and work-related attributes using machine learning models. This is a classification problem.

Dataset Overview:
Source:  UCI Adult dataset.
Features: Briefly highlight key features such as age, education, occupation, marital status, hours worked, etc.
Target Variable: Income level (binary: >$50K or <=$50K).

Approach:
Data Preprocessing: Address steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize key trends, correlations, and distributions.
Model Building: Mention models used (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, GradientBoost,ect..) and highlight their advantages.
Evaluation Metrics: Focus on accuracy, precision,and ROC-AUC.

Results:
Showcase the performance of the best-performing model with metrics and visualizations like confusion matrices or ROC curves.
Highlight insights from feature importance.

Conclusion
The Adult dataset analysis project revealed that factors such as education level, occupation, age, and marital status
significantly influences an individual's income exceeding $50,000 per year. Machine Learning models, including Logistic Regression,
Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, SVM, Gradient Boosting were trained and evaluated on the preprocessed data.
Here Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 87%. 
This anlysis provide valuable insights like socioeconomic factors contributing to income equality.
